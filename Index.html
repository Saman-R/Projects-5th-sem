        <p>One of the great urban centres of India, Kolkata is to its proud citizens equal to any city in the country in
            charm, variety and interest. The showpiece capital of the British Raj was the greatest colonial city of the
            Orient. People from all over the world came seeking fortune during its trading boom in the eighteenth and
            nineteenth centuries. Their descendants are still noticeable in the city's cosmopolitan mix of communities.
            Despite this, there has been a rise in Bengali nationalism over the last twenty years, and in 2001 the city
            was officially renamed Kolkata (its precolonial Bengali name).</p>
